# NHS - User Research Panels

Terms of reference (early draft v0.0.1). To be reviewed after the kick off workshop on June 8th

For questions about this project email Tom: thomas.hallam@nhs.net

**Project context:**
- NHS Digital has conducted over 600 surveys in the past few years (using the survey tool Qualtrics)
- The organisation has established mulitple research panels, with over 500,000 participants signing up
- Access to qualified participants has been fundamental to the success of user research projects across NHSD and our health partner organisations (e.g. DHSC, UKHSA, NHSE)


**Project assumptions:**
- Teams have collected different data when users opt-in, depending on their local project needs
- It can be difficult to find appropriate users as data filters do not match up across teams
- Some participants have joined several panels, which means there may be a data mismatch
- It is difficult to know which data is accurate and which data should be archived

**The goal of this project is to:**
- Improve the management of research panels across the NHS
- Understand what data has been collected about our users 
- Document UR panel & demographic patterns
- Learn how the survey demographic questions have been iterated over time
- Collaborate towards agreeing an updated baseline set of questions for the (citizen) research panel
