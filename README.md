# NHSD - User Research Panels

**Project context:**
- NHS Digital has conducted over 600 surveys in the past few years using the survey tool Qualtrics.
- The organisation has established mulitple research panels, with over 500,000 participants signing up.
- Access to qualified participants has been fundamental to the success of user research projects across NHSD and our health partner organisations (e.g. DHSC, UKHSA, NHSE)


**Project assumptions:**
- Teams have collected different data when users opt-in, depending on their local project needs
- It can be difficult to find appropriate users as data filters do not match up across teams
- Some participants have joined several panels, which means there may be a data mismatch
- It is difficult to know which data is accurate and which data should be archived

**The goal of this project is to:**
- Improve the management of research panels across NHSD
- Understand what data has been collected about our users 
- Document UR panel demographic patterns
- Learn how the survey demographic questions have been iterated over time
- Collaborate towards agreeing an updaed baseline set of questions for the (citizen) research panel
