## Principles of Good Panel managment

There are key principles that apply to ensure good practice, such as

- **Opt-in**: participants are invited to join the panel
- **Opt-out**: participants can ask to be removed at any time
- **Informed consent**: participants must be provided a clear overview of what they are signing up for before taking part (e.g. the panel and research projects)
- **Information governance**:
  - any panel member can ask for a copy of their own data (e.g. a subject access request)
  - participants can be asked to be delete from the panel at any time
  - **No (data) duplication**: all data should only be stored in one place
  - Data archiving
