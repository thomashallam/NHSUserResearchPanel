# Research panel guidelines

## What is a research panel?

Any list of contacts (e.g. names and email addresses) that may be used for research purposes, could be considered a research panel.

Research panel can be set up for a specific research projects, or to enable ongoing research engagement across several teams/programmes/organisations.

## Should we set up a research panel?

- **Benefits of having a research panel**
  - Direct acccess to wide range of users groups
  - Reduce reliance/delays when managing external agencies
  - Reduce cost of external recruitment
  - User data retained within the organisation
  - Make use of existing service traffic
  - Access niche participant groups that agencies may not be able to find
  - Can integrate sign-up processes with user journey

- **Things to consider first:**
  - Time needed to set up and manage a panel
  - Software & tooling requirements
  - Information governance / data privacy / security
  - Ongoing maintenance of the panel
  - Who will book participants for research
  - Re-ops training for researchers (and colleagues)
  - Communication plan / user engagement
  - Incentivisation approach, budgeting
  
## Principles of Good Panel managment

There are key principles that apply to ensure good practice, such as

- **Opt-in**: participants are invited to join the panel
- **Opt-out**: participants can ask to be removed at any time
- **Informed consent**: participants must be provided a clear overview of what they are signing up for before taking part (e.g. the panel and research projects)
- **Information governance**:
  - any panel member can ask for a copy of their own data (e.g. a subject access request)
  - participants can be asked to be delete from the panel at any time
  - **No (data) duplication**: all data should only be stored in one place
  - **Data refresh**
  - **Data archiving**

## How to set up a panel

Typically a list of respondents for a survey, who have additionally opted in to join a panel for future research

**Closed / Private panel**
This is most common in the research industry:
- often a spreadsheet (or database) of members
- use of a crm / mailing system
- use bespoke panel tools
- How it works:
  - Participants are segmented and sampled
  - Those selected are individually invited to the research project
  - Participants are often limited to how many projects they can take part in
  - Participants may receive an incentive per project, or after completing several tasks

**Open panel / communities**
Historically known as "market research online communities" MROCs. This method is less commonly used, however, some customer-centric organisations have grown significantly due to their advid user-engagement and the insights generated in their communities.

- **Benefits:**
  - Most open and transparent form of user and community engagement
  - Grass-roots level thinking, online
  - Most detailed insights / discussions
  - Diverse audeiences: appeals to younger users and not just typical research participants
  - Through sentiment analytics, trends can be identified
  
- **Cautions:**
  - Highly resource intensive to manage
  - Often large amounts of unstructured data which are difficult to analyse
  - Discussions can spiral out of control
  - Risk of intellectual property loss
  - Not appropriate for more sensitive topics

- **How it works:**
  - anyone in the open panel can message anyone else
  - moderator is required for checking all content
  - faciltation required for prompting/guiding discussions
  - usually a time-based incentive for members (e.g. 3 month period)
  - or sometimes microincentives for ongoing participation
