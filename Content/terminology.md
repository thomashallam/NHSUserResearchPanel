# Research panel guidelines

## Terminology

**Segment/segmentation**: Creating groups of users with specific characteristics. e.g. "people who visited their GP within the last 6 months", "parents between the age 20-40, who are also vaccinated". **When to do this?**: this process helps to ensure representation from key groups who are likely to use a service, as well as groups the team assumes may struggle when using the service

**Sampling**: The process of selecting a sub-set of the users from the panel e.g. of the 1,000 users on the panel the team want to speak with a randomly-selected sample of 10.

**Sample criteria**: A brief for which participants can be recruited. The sample criteria may include multiple segments that need to be balanced by the recruiter.
E.g. team want to speak to 10 people, including a mix of genders, from a variety of age groups, and split across the regions in UK (Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, England).
